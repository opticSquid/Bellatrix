# BELLATRIX

## A Express JS project to provide you with a starter application framework for your Node JS application with built in routes and functionalities for the authentication and authorization needs of your application. We mainly focus on the **security** of the authentication and authorization routes


### We keep implementing all the latest security measures and best practices that are required for the application's data to remain secure and make sure data and access is available to only the ones intended to. We do the boring security stuff so that you can enjoy your time building other exciting functionalities with out worrying about the security of your application

We follow some basic rules for the security of the app.

- We use the [JWT](https://jwt.io/) for the authentication and authorization of the application

- We use an approach of time based token for the authentication and authorization of the application
  
- For this user gets 2 tokens after successful login. One is called `access_token` **(valid for 15 mins)** and the other is called `refresh_token`
  
- Every time the user makes a request to a protected route, the `access_token` should be sent in the `Authorization` header

- Everytime the `access_token` expires, the user can request a new `access_token` by sending a **GET** request to `\token` route. The `refresh_token` should be provided in the `Authorization` header of the request


> While keeping an eye on the security we also focus on performance, scalability and reusablity of the code by breaking the code to small middlewares and asynchronizing the processes as much as possible. We parallelize the promises and network requests when ever possible to make the application more performant scalable and reusable.


## Steps to get started

1. Clone the *Bellatrix* repository.
2. Make sure to install the latest **LTS version of Node JS**
3. After navigating to the project root directory, run the following command:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
    
4. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. This file will contain the environment variables required for the application to run.
 The file should contain the following fields:

 - `DB_URI` - *URI of the MongoDB database*.
 - `JWT_ACS_SECRET` - *Secret key for the JWT `access_token`*
 - `JWT_REF_SECRET` - *Secret key for the JWT `refresh_token`*
  
 5. Run the following command to start the application in production mode:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
   
6. To start the application in development mode, run the following command:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
